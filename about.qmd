Hi! My name is Rithvik Guntor. I graduated from Virginia Tech with a Bachelor's in Computational Modeling Data Analytics in December 2022. I am a current VT CS graduate student interested in the fields of software engineering and machine learning. In order to further explore the field of ML, I wrote a few blogs to dive deeper into these concepts through Breast Cancer data.
